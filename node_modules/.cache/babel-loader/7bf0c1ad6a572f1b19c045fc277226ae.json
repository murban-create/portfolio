BirdNET is a research platform used to predict bird species from audio recordings through vocalizations. The aim was to enhance the interpretability of these complex data sets through innovative visualization techniques.</p>\n\n              In the realâ€‘time visualization (as seen in the livestream), each cluster shows how similar different audio recordings areâ€”essentially, each cluster corresponds roughly to one bird species. The white sphere that moves through the plot represents the systemâ€™s classification of the most recent threeâ€‘second audio snippet: its position along one axis reflects which species it thinks it most likely is, and along the other axis how closely the snippetâ€™s spectrogram (audio profile) matches the existing recordings. On the left, you can also pick any individual bird (species) youâ€™re interested in to highlight just that cluster.\n    <h5>Research Questions:</h5>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Data Analysis: Conducted extensive data analysis to understand the clustering and classification of bird species based on their vocalizations using UMAP.</li>\n        <li>Real-Time Data Processing: Integrated live audio data streams with a maximum delay of 2 seconds into the visualization framework.</li>\n        <li>Visualization Design and Implementation: Created a dynamic 3D and 2D visualization prototype with a time slider to explore the data across temporal dimensions.</li>\n        <li>Evaluation Design: Conceived and executed an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the visualization in enhancing user engagement and learning.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h5>Achievements:</h5>\n    <p>Successfully developed a visualization tool that not only aids in the academic exploration of bioacoustics data but also serves as a step towards explainable AI in the field of environmental science.
