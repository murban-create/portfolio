BirdNET is a research platform used to predict bird species from audio recordings through vocalizations. The aim was to enhance the interpretability of these complex data sets through innovative visualization techniques.</p>\n\n              In the real‑time visualization (as seen in the livestream), each cluster shows how similar different audio recordings are—essentially, each cluster corresponds roughly to one bird species. The white sphere that moves through the plot represents the system’s classification of the most recent three‑second audio snippet: its position along one axis reflects which species it thinks it most likely is, and along the other axis how closely the snippet’s spectrogram (audio profile) matches the existing recordings. On the left, you can also pick any individual bird (species) you’re interested in to highlight just that cluster.\n    <h5>Research Questions:</h5>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Data Analysis: Conducted extensive data analysis to understand the clustering and classification of bird species based on their vocalizations using UMAP.</li>\n        <li>Real-Time Data Processing: Integrated live audio data streams with a maximum delay of 2 seconds into the visualization framework.</li>\n        <li>Visualization Design and Implementation: Created a dynamic 3D and 2D visualization prototype with a time slider to explore the data across temporal dimensions.</li>\n        <li>Evaluation Design: Conceived and executed an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the visualization in enhancing user engagement and learning.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h5>Achievements:</h5>\n    <p>Successfully developed a visualization tool that not only aids in the academic exploration of bioacoustics data but also serves as a step towards explainable AI in the field of environmental science.
